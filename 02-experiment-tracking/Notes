# Model Registry
--> A model registry is a centralized repository that stores , manages, and tracks ML models  across their entire lifecycle think as like a library where you can :
1. Store models (trained & tested)
2. Track model versions and updates
3. Document model performance & metrics
4. Share models with team and deploy to production
5. Monitor model drift & retraining needs


# Note
--> It is actually not deploying any model it only lists what are the models that are " Production - Ready "
--> We need to complete the model registry with some CI/CD code in order to do the actual deployment of those models.


# Model management in MLFlow
It provides :
1. Model lineage
2. Model Version
3. Stage transitions &
4. Annotations
