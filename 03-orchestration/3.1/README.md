# Data preparation: ETL and feature engineering

# Ingestion
 # Data Ingestion in Machine Learning
 Data ingestion is the process of collecting, processing, and storing data for machine learning model training.

# Data preparation - Ingestion
  The project unit_1_data_preparation now has an empty pipeline, and it can be developed further using blocks. The first one we'll create is an ingestion block, which uses Python code to download the parquet files from January to March of the green taxi datasets and concatenate them. Done that, generate a series of graphs and charts useful for data profiling.

# Utility helper functions
  Utility functions are already created in the utils folder. They will be then imported into the transformer block.

# Data Preparation

# Build training sets

# Data validations using built-in testing framework
